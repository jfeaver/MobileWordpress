# Mobile Wordpress

A WordPress website built on the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS framework by ZURB (version 2.2.1).  The initial WordPress theme
was built by github user: [drewsymo](https://github.com/drewsymo/Foundation).  I downloaded his theme in May 2012 (git commit 5109b0ffe1cc9ae453868601ecc4cd651285b805).

##Foundation

Features Used:

- Grid system: Makes site-mobilification quick and eases the task of creating CSS for layout
- Buttons: Buttons are built in so it's fast to build a prototype
- Mobile Layouts: CSS Drop Down Menu generates on mobile site for compact site navigation
- Orbit jQuery Slider: Unknown incompatibility between old version of WP theme and new version of Foundation/Orbit.

##html5shiv and HTML5 Boilerplate

These tools are included with the original WP theme

##modernizr

This tool was included with the newest version of Foundation but has not been implemented in the WP theme.
